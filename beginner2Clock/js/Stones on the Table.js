// There are some stones on Bob's table in a row, and each of them can be red, green or blue, indicated by the characters R, G, and B.

// Help Bob find the minimum number of stones he needs to remove from the table so that the stones in each pair of adjacent stones have different colours.

// Examples:
// "RGBRGBRGGB"   => 1
// "RGGRGBBRGRR"  => 3
// "RRRRGGGGBBBB" => 9
